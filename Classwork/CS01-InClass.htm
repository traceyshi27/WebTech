        <p>I chose Babson because I knew I wanted to do business but wanted a school that had more of a set path for the first two years. I also liked how it was easier to find people who were doing the same concentration as you, which made it easier to network and ask for help. I want to work with data analysis when I graduate, but more specifically with food or restaurant data.</p>
        <p>My favorite sports are volleyball and tennis.</p>
